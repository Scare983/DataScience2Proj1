Modeling Techniques: Regression, RidgeRegression, LassoRegression, QuadRegression, QuadXRegression, CubicRegression, CubicXRegression, ANCOVA. Datasets: AutoMPG, Concrete, and 3 more from UCI Machine Learning Repository. Do data-preprocessing (section 3.4) and exploratory data analysis (section 4.4) for each dataset. Use forward selection to add one feature/parameter at a time and record rSq, rSqBar and rSqCV and plot them versus the number of parameters (n). Do this for every modeling technique. Determine the best value n* for rSqBar and rSqCV. How similar are they? Call summary for the best model and explain its output. Read section 1.3.
